# Who is this guide for?
* You've already gone through the trouble of [installing and configuring Zenoss](http://community.zenoss.org/community/documentation).


* You've since learned that things in your network - important things - occasionally break.

* You would like to know when things do break. You have a mobile phone that can receieve SMS messages and can't stop thinking "There must be a solution in here somewhere!" 

# What can be done?

# Amazing. Now how can I do this for myself?
## There are some prerequisites
* All your devices are well organised into Locations, Systems, Groups, Networks, and - most importantly - Classes. If not, [take some time to do this](http://www.packtpub.com/article/zenoss-core-3x-device-setup-administration) and come back to this guide later. 

* You have an account with [Nexmo](http://nexmo.com/). Nexmo "is a cloud-based SMS API that lets you send and receive high volume of messages at wholesale rates." They're also the most cost-effective solution I know of for this task.
