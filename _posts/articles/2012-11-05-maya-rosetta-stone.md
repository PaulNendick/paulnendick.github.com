# Who is this guide for?
Anyone who uses Autodesk Maya in anger, especially those of us doing so on Linux platforms.


# What can be done?
Maya provides to its users an enormous array of sporadically documented features and configuration options. These environment variables, XML config files and the like allow the user fine-grained control over:

* icons
* plug-ins
* modules
* Mel scripts
* Python scripts
* shaders
* stability of Maya itself
* more

# Prerequisites

* Maya 2011 or newer
* Linux, although much of this likely applies to Maya on Windows and OS X
* bash shell and not csh as the latter is [bad for you](http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/shell/csh-whynot)

# Environment Variables
