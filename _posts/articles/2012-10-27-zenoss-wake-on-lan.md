# Waking Zenoss devices using wake-on-lan

[Zenoss](http://www.zenoss.com/) is a remarkably featureful monitoring system straight out of the box. But it lacks an obvious one that anyone who's gone through the trouble of monitoring lots of devices will miss: [wake-on-LAN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN).

##Who is this guide for?

* You've already gone through the trouble of [installing and configuring Zenoss](http://community.zenoss.org/community/documentation).

* You've got loads of hardware on your network with Wake-on-LAN enabled

* There's a machine on your network that you really want powered on but isn't. It's really far away, you're lazy and it's cold outside.
